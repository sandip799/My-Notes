# Data Structure
- This is the most commonly used word in programming field
-  A Data Structure is a collection of different forms and different types of data that has a specific set of operation that can be performed
- A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data.
## Advantages of using Data Structure
 #### Connect Program To Real World
 - Typical base data types, such as integer or floating values, that are available in most computer programming language are generally insufficient to capture the logical intent of data processing
 - yet those applications which are producing information how data organized to simplify processing
	 - ex- everyone have a facebook or instagram account
	 - try to remember that when you open that application then you will see the post which is recently posted by whom you following
	 - similarly other post are one after another, so here instagram uses stack data structure to implement that particular thing, so that it can produce information in a way that helps the user to understand the whole scenario

#### Increase Efficiency
   - If you choose the proper data structure for your program then it will increase your program efficiency
   - but before you have to ask some question to get the answer of which data structure is best for your problem, question are
	 1.  What kind of information will be stored?
	2.  How will that information be used?
	3.  Where should data persist, or be kept, after it is created?
	4.  What is the best way to organize the data?
	5.  What aspects of memory and storage reservation management should be considered?
#### Managing resources and services
- Core operating system (OS) resources and services are enabled through the use of data structures such as linked list for memory allocation, file directory management and file structure trees, as well as process scheduling queues.

#### Data Exchange
   - Data structures define the organization of information shared between applications, such as TCP/IP packets.

#### Scalability
