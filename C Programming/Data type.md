# Data Type
#### Data Type
- This is the most basic and common classification of data
- by this compiler gets to know the form or the type of information that will be used throughout the code
- again a question arises that `Why compiler gets to know about data type?` because after knowing the data type it allocates memory because when we declare integer variable then it takes 4bytes of memory while character takes 1byte, for efficient memory allocation datatype is important
