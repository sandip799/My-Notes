## Function In General
##### Before we are going deep into programming definition, first ask a question to yourself that what is function, where you heard this word before ?

in your schooling you definitely heard this word in mathematics,just remember all the trigonometric functions that you learn like sin, cos, tan, cot etc. These all are function, your work is just to give inputs to it and it will provide you output. Remember when you first learn about all trigonometric values of common angles like sin 0, sin 30, sin 45 etc, you only remember these just because it will be useful when you will face math problems but less students have a question that "sir, why sin 0 value is 0 not 1 ?", be patience , we will discuss all the concepts, lets dive into this topic.

#### What is The Definition of Function ?
- A function relates an input to an outputÂ

"**f(x) = ...** " is the classic way of writing a function.  
And there are other ways, as you will see!
#### Input, Relationship, Output

We will see many ways to think about functions, but there are always three main parts:

-   The input
-   The relationship
-   The output

Let us understand all the above definition, lets think about a DVD Player, when you put CD Disc inside it and turn on the switch then  `What it will give you?` obviously it will show something on your screen. So basically CD Disc is input to the function DVD Player, again if you will input a music CD player inside the DVD player it only plays all the songs inside it so basically input related to the output, but if here it plays videos instead of music then there is no relationship between the input and output.
