## Identification 
- Just search for 2 keyword, one is **K** and another one is **Smallest/Largest**
- if **K** with **Smallest** is given then **MAX HEAP**
-  if **K** with **Largest** is given then **MIN HEAP**
-  **Note** - Maximum No of Heap questions are based on sorting, and we already studied that the best time complexity for sorting is **O(nlogn)** and by using heap we can reduce this to **O(nlogk)** and remember that most of the heap question have the simple solution that is based upon sorting
