# Recursion Kunal Kushwaha
## Introduction
- It helps us to solving bigger or complex problems in a single way
- You can convert recursion solution to iteration and vice versa
- Space Complexity is not constant because of recursive call
- It helps to breaking bigger problems into smaller problems
## How To Understand & Approach A Problem
1. Identify if you can break down problems into smaller problems
2. Write down the recurrence relation if needed
3. Draw the recursive tree
	#### About the tree
	1. See the flow of function, how they are getting in stack
	2. Identify and focus on left tree calls and right tree calls
	3. Draw the tree and pointers again and again using pen and paper
	4. Use the debugger to see the flow 
	5. See the value and what type of values(int string etc) are returned at each step
	6. See where the function call will come out, in the end you will come out of the main function
## Variables In Recursion
1. Arguments 
2. Return Type
3. Body Of The Function

## Recurrence Relation
### Linear Recurrence Relation
- Fibonacci Series
- Here calls are made in linear way
### Divide & Conquer Recurrence Relation
- Binary Search
- Here calls are made by reducing it by factor
