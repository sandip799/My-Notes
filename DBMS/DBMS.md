# DBMS
- DBMS stands for Data Base Management System
- **DATA**- Facts, Figures, Statics etc having no particular meaning
	ex- 1, ABC, 21
- **Data Base**- Collection of inter related data, here interrelated data means they are somehow sharing a common attribute
- **DBM**-All the operations taken over the data to manage it properly is known as DBM
- **DBMS**-This is a software or set of instruction used to modify or manipulate the data.

#### Explanation
- we know about data that it is a raw fact which have no particular meaning
- Data Base meaning collection of interrelated data, this means suppose in a folder you only store the music video, so all the data in that folder shares a common property that all are music videos but if you store music video, software files, images etc together in a folder in that case they are not interrelated because they don't share any common property
- Data Base Management means to manipulate the data, manipulation like insert, delete, update etc
- Data Base Management System is nothing but a software which is used to manipulate the data but not manually, by using the software because when we have the large amount of data then it is difficult to manipulate all the data manually, yes it is possible but it will take a lots of time but by using the software we can do it in fraction of second.
##### Division Of Database
- Basically we divide the database into three parts
