worlds apart you standing in front of me but you so far 
its getting hard to think of the reason we stay in the dark 
would it be for the better if we both just surrender let it go being with each other
is breaking our heart
so tell me why are we fighting for is it really worth the battle 
we have been going back and forth like an echo echo echo echo
i hurt you then you hold me close we get off on the tide and lows 
we have been going back and forth like an echo echo echo echo

how you gonna play me like that 
why you make it so complicated 
now am under your control and now i cant take it anymore why cant you just close the door pushing and you pulling me back now am under your control and i cant take it any\
anymore
