- Data is coming from various sources and program responsibility is to process those data and giving the desired output but one thing we have to mark is data may be coming in large scale so we have to store the data in main memory so that our program can extract it and use it, again we already studied that we have an data structure that is array to store a group of data but the question is is't enough? No, there are some sort of problems may arises that can't be resolved only by storing the data in the array that's why we use collection framework
