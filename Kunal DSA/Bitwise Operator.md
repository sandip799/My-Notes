- when you and 1 with a number then the number remain same
- XOR (if and only if), this means only one should be true
- a ^ 1 = a complement
- a ^ 0 = a 
- a ^ a = 0
- Complement(~) - complement the numbers 
- Left shift operator - a << 1 = 2a,  so a << b = a * 2^b
- Similarly in right shift is dividing the number by 2^b
