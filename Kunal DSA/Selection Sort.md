# Selection Sort
- This sorting algorithm is used when the array list is too small like 20 - 30 elements in the array
- It is more faster than O(nlogn) when the array size is too small
- **Strength** 
	- **Intuitive** - Ever packed a suitcase, putting in large items before smaller ones? That's selection sort!
	- **Space Efficient** - Selection sort only requires a constant amount of additional space (O(1)).
- **Weaknesses:**
	-   **Slow**. Selection sort takes O(n^2) time, even if the input is already sorted. That's too slow to be used on super-big data sets.
