# Peterson Solution
- This is a classical software based solution but not fit for modern days computer
- But if you want to gain knowledge about how to design a software based solution for critical section problem then it will give brief description and provide some important knowledge and view some complex aspect that you have to taken care of while writing or analyzing any software based algorithm
- The main disadvantage is it restricted to two process that alternate their critical section and reminder section, but here question arises that `can we apply peterson solution on the os where more than two processes are in the queue?`
## Knowledge Before Going Into The Algorithm
- Basically it uses two variable that is shared between 2 processes
- one is turn variable and another is flag array of size two and boolean data type
- so basically turn variable indicates that which process turn to go inside the critical section, ex- suppose there are two process Pi and Pj, where turn == i, then here Pi turn to enter into the critical section
- Flag variable is used indicate that which process wants to enter into the critical section, so suppose flag value of Pi == true then Pi wants to enter into the critical section.
- But here is twist, Peterson Solution is a humble algorithm , `why you said humble ?` because it ask another process that "you want to enter into critical section?", let suppose Pi wants to enter into the critical section then it first tell Pj that "you want to enter into the critical section ?" that's why we call it as a humble algorithm

## Algorithm
```cpp
//Process Pi code
do {
	flag[i] = true;						//ENTRY SECTION
	turn = j;
	while(flag[j] && turn == [j]);
	
		critical section
	
	flag[i] = false;					//EXIT SECTION
	
		reminder section 
		
	}while(TRUE);
```
```cpp
//Process Pj code
do {
	flag[j] = true;						//ENTRY SECTION
	turn = i;
	while(flag[i] && turn == [i]);
	
		critical section
	
	flag[j] = false;					//EXIT SECTION
	
		reminder section 
		
	}while(TRUE);
```
## Workflow
#### Case 1:
- So first those process among 2 which wants to enter into the critical section set it flag = true
- yes at a time two processes set their flag values to true
- so suppose we start execution from the process Pi, so here Pi set its flag to true then after that as you that it is a humble algorithm so it set the turn value to j and ask to the second process that "you want to enter into the critical section ?", so if Pj value is set to false then it again change value to i then the while condition will run
- in while condition here written a and condition so if two condition satisfies then it goes to infinite loop or not.
- so as in this situation while condition becomes false because flag[j] = false
- so it goes into critical section then at last change its flag value to false and came out of the critical section 

#### Case 2:
- so when Pj also wants to enter into the critical section then when Pi sets turn value to j , then if the Pj process is executed from first line then it change its turn variable again to i
- so at that stage Pi process situated at while loop , so it checks condition and condition becomes false and then it executes its critical section 
-  and while Pi is execution on critical section at that time Pj process situated at while loop , so as all the condition is true so it goes on infinite loop
-  when Pi end its critical section execution and change its flag to false then at that time Pj came out from the while loop and execute its critical section 

## Is It Satisfy All The Requirements ?
- Mutual Exclusion
	- As we can see here that when Pi is executing on critical section then Pj cant enter into critical section so it satisfies mutual exclusion condition.

- Progress
	- Progress means if no process is executing in its critical section and some process wants to enter into the critical section, then only those processes that are not executing in their remainder sections can participate in the decision on which will enter its critical section next and this selection cant be postponed
	- so at this stag, Pi and Pj both are not working on its reminder section and here both are participate in decision making that which process should go by using turn variable and the process of who should go first was not indefinite so this satisfy the progress requirement

- Bounded Waiting
	- Here no process which is requesting to use the critical section is not waiting for indefinite time because as soon as one process end its execution inside the critical section suddenly another process went inside the critical section, so it satisfies the bounded waiting criteria

## Drawback
- Cant implement in modern computer architecture
- Works only on two processes

## Summary
- So basically this is a process synchronization problem which work only on two processes and help to solve the critical section problem but not in modern days but it gives a brief so that you can focus on those complex fields which are important
