# Python Day 1
- You cant write code like `print("print("hello world !")")`
- This will show an error because at this point `"print("` compiler will thought that this is the only string and other are code and generate an error message

## String Concatenation
```py
print("hello" + " " + "Sandip")
```
- so basically it takes those separate strings and then merge those strings into one

## Indentation Error
- In python space plays a vital role means suppose you write an code like
```py
print("Hello world !");
```
- The above program will run without showing an error
- But if you write code with a space from beginning then it will show and indentation error
```py
  print("Hello world !")
```
- So its really important in python to start writing code from beginning

## Input Function
- It is kind of print function where it ask for some input with printing a message on screen 
- In print statement in only prints the statement and end the line but here cursor will stay in that line and wait for user input

```py
input("Enter any number")
```
```py
print("Hello "+ input("Enter your name-"))
```
- In the above example basically first print function get executed and first hello is converted to string, then when it going for concatenation then it encounter another function that is input so is executes that and print "enter your name " in terminal 
- Then after user giving some input it replaces that input function with the user input and again convert that into a string then print that with hello
