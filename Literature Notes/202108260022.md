## Updating & Deleting
```sql
UPDATE student
SET major = 'Bio'
WHERE major = 'Biology' ;
```
- So basically it updates the student table with major = "Bio" where major = "Biology"

#### Update Using OR Operator
```sql
UPDATE student
SET major = 'Biochemistry'
WHERE major = 'Biology' OR major = 'Chemistry' ;
```
#### Updating Multiple Values
```sql
UPDATE student
SET name = 'Tom', major = 'undecided'
WHERE student_id = 1;
```
- So basically it updates name to Tom & major to undecided where student id is 1

#### Drop The Where
```sql
UPDATE student
SET major = 'undecided';
```
- So it basically updates all the rows major value to undecided

### Deleting
#### Deleting All The Rows
```sql
DELETE FROM student;
```
#### Deleting A Specific Row
```sql
DELETE FROM student
WHERE student_id = 5;
```
#### Deleting Using AND
```sql
DELETE FROM student
WHERE name = 'TOM' AND major = 'undecided';
```
## Basic Queries
#### Retrieve All The Column Data
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM student;
```
- Basically this means select all the columns from student table
- Here * Symbol used for all

#### Retrieve Specific Columns
```sql
SELECT name 
FROM student;
```
```sql
SELECT name, major 
FROM student;
```
#### ORDER BY
```sql
SELECT name, major 
FROM student
ORDRE BY name;
```
- Basically it order the name in ascending order
- and it by default ascending order
- if you want to order it by descending order then use the keyword DESC
```sql
SELECT name, major 
FROM student
ORDRE BY name DESC;
```
```sql
SELECT name, major 
FROM student
ORDRE BY major,student_id DESC;
```
- Here it first order by major and if any student have same major then it order that in by student_id
- here as we set student_id DESC , that means if similar major will occur then it order it by descending order, but by default it is ascending
#### LIMIT
```sql
SELECT name, major 
FROM student
LIMTI 2;
```
- after running this query it will show only two student in output
- You can also combine the ORDER BY & LIMIT 

```sql
SELECT name, major 
FROM student
ORDRE BY student_id DESC
LIMTI 2;
```
- you can also put some condition to view the columns

```sql
SELECT * 
FORM student
WHERE major = 'Chemistry';
```
- so basically it view only those students having the major chemistry
```sql
SELECT name,major 
FORM student
WHERE major = 'Chemistry' OR major = 'Biology';
```
- there are bunch of relational operators like **<, <=, >, >=, <>, AND, OR**
#### IN 
```sql
SELECT name,major 
FORM student
WHERE name IN ('Clair', 'Kate', 'Mike');
```
- so basically it return the columns where name is Clair, Kate & Mike
