# Python Day 2
## String Subscripting
```py
print("Hello[0]")
```
- Output of above program becomes 'H'
```py
print("123" + "345")
```
- Output becomes "123345", basically when we write something using double quote mark then it count as string

## Integer Manipulation
```py
print(123_456_789)
```
- So basically it is an integer and if we print this element then output becomes 123456789, it don't print the underscore
- Basically we write big amount or number using comma operator like 123,456,789
- in python we use the underscore symbol so that it becomes more readable for the programmer

##  Boolean Data Type
- Boolean are of two types , True & False
- and remember that whenever you declaring boolean data type and assign any value then write its first letter as capital in python
```py
bool = True
```
- if you write it using small letter then it count as an error

## Type Error & Type Checking & Type Casting
#### Type Error
- if we have to check a value of which data type then we use type() to check
```py
print(type(123))
```
- so its output looks like "<class 'int'>"
- so it means that this variable is of type integer

#### Type Checking
```py
print(len(1234))
```
- when you write this code and run it then it will show an error of type checking
- it meas that here length function can't read the size of an integer , it only read the size of a string
```py
TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()
```
- this is the error that will showing while you run the code

#### Type Casting
- Type casting means change a variable data type to another data type
```py
num = 123
num_f = float(num) # it converts the interger value to float
print(type(num_f))
```
- so in above program first we define a integer variable named as num
- then convert it into float by using the method type casting, so its type convert from integer to float
- then when we print this using type function then the output becomes 
```py
<class 'float'>
```
- similarly to convert something to string we write code like bellow
```py
num = 123
print(type(str(num)))
```
- we use str() function to convert something from other data type to float
```py
#what will be the output of following codes
print(str(70) + str(100))

#Output
70100
```
- so in above program we change the integer data type to string and when we use the plus operator then it concatenates those two as these are strings
##### Exercise
###### Write a program to add the digits of two number
**NOTE** - Always remember that whenever you take an input from the user using the input(), then by default its type becomes string no matter which type of data you will enter
- Suppose you enter an number 123 , but it automatically converted into string 
```py
num = input("Enter the number:-")
print(type(num))
print(int(num[0]) + int(num[1]))
```
## Mathematical Operation In Python
- whenever you trying to divide something then the output always comes in the form of a float variable
- exponent is built-in in python, so that's why it loved most
```py
print(2 ** 2)
#output
4
```
- It follows the PEMDAS precedence rule, P for parenthesis, E for exponent then M for multiplication then D for division then A for addition then S for subtraction
- We already know that division and multiplication have the same precedence and addition and division also 
- so if there are some mathematical term given to find out the result then you have to calculate from left to right, that is the associativity of arithmetic operators
## Number Manipulation & F String in Python
- There is a function named as round() which round off the number that you passed as a parameter
```py
print(round(1.5))
#output
2
```
- You can also round off the number according to your need means after some decimal digit in the number. lets understand this with an example
```py
print(round(1.666666,2))
#OUTPUT
1.67
```
- So basically it round off the number until 2 digits after the decimal point
#### Floor Calculation 
```py
print(8 // 3)
#OUTPUT
2
```
#### F- String
- when you have to print something like int or other data type with an string, you cant do this in one line of code
- but using this f-string you can do this
```py
name = "sandip"
age = 21
height = 5.10
print(f"your name is {name}, age {age} and your height is {height}")
```
- so basically you have to write f before the double quote mark
- and if you have to insert any value then use the curly braces symbol and write the variable name inside it
```py
//OUTPUT
your name is sandip, age 21 and your height is 5.1
```
##### Exercise
**Create a tip calculator which shows amount up to two decimal digits**
```py
print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
tip = int(input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? "))
total_people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))
tip_amount = bill * tip / 100
total_bill = bill + tip_amount
print(f"Each person should pay$: {round(total_bill / total_people,2)}")

//output
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? $150
How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
Each person should pay: 33.6
```
- but in the above program the problem is is showing only one digit after the decimal point but we need two and we also define two, so why this not showing
- so basically in this example 33.6 is the final result and after that there is no decimal digit available thats why it is not showing 
- and if you want that it will show like 33.60 then you have to format this little bit
```py
final_amount = "{:.2f}".format(total_bill / total_people)
```
- Basically it format as we write .2f so will show only two digits after the decimal point
