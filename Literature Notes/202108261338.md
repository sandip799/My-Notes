### Arrays
- Remember that the maximum size of the array that we can define inside the main function is 10^6 and when we declare globally then its maximum size is 10^7
- whereas if we declare the array of boolean type then the maximum size of the array inside the main function is 10^7 and globally 10^8
```cpp
array<int, 5> arr;
```
```cpp
array<int, 5> arr = {1};
// {1,0,0,0,0}
```
- Basically this initialize the first index value to 1 and if it declare inside the int main() then other values become 0
#### fill()
- Basically this function fills all the values of array to the number passed to it as a parameter
```cpp
array<int, 5> arr;
arr.fill(5);
//array becomes {5,5,5,5,5}
```
#### at()
- this is used to return the value at that particular index
- it is like subscript operator we use to access a element of a particular index
```cpp
array<int,5> arr = {1,2,3,4,5};
cout<<arr.at(2);
//output
3
```
#### front()
- this returns the first element of the array 
- the alternative of this is arr.at(0)
#### back()
- similarly this is used to return the last element of the array
- again its alternative is 
#### size()
#### Iterators 
- begin(), end(), rbegin(), rend()
- Basically these iterators are working on all the data structures
- **begin()** - it returns the base address 
- **end()** - it returns the next address of the end index
- **rbegin()** - basically it means reverse begin, it returns the end index
- **rend()** - basically it returns the index before the starting index
##### Example
```cpp
array<int, 5> arr;
arr.fill(5);
for(auto it = arr.begin(); it != arr.end(); it++) {
	cout<<*it<<" ";
}
//OUTPUT
5 5 5 5 5 
```
```cpp
array<int, 5> arr = {1,2,3,4,5};
 for (auto it = arr.rbegin(); it != arr.rend(); it++) {
 cout<<*it<<" ";
 }
 ```
 - you will be wondering that here it-- should be written but it++ gives the write answer, basically it prints the array in the reverse order
### Vectors
- This is the modified version of the array and the modification is it we dont have to declare the size of the array, it will automatically allocate the memory according to the user need, so this is basically uses the dynamic memory allocation 
#### Function Used in The Vectors
##### Declaration Syntax
```cpp
vector<int> first;
```
- as you can see that we don't mention any size in this
- **first.push_back** - this function is used to push elements in the last of the vector
-**first.pop_back()** - this function is used to delete the elements from the end of the array
- **first.clear()** - it will directly clear all the elements form the vector 
- **first.emplace_back()** - this is as same as push back but the only difference is it takes slightly less time than push_back()
- **swap(vec1,vec2)** - this function helps to swap the elements
##### Declare Vector With Initial Size
- you can create a vector with your own size
```cpp
vector<int> first(7);
```
- if you print the vector then all the index value filled with 0 by default
- again you can input your own value and the syntax is given below
```cpp
vector<int> first(7,10);
//op
{10,10,10,10,10,10,10}
```
##### Copy Elements From One Vector To Another Vector
- if you want to copy elements from one vector to another vector then the syntax is
```cpp
 vector<int> vec1 = {1,2,3,4,5};
 vector<int> vec2 (vec1.begin(),vec1.end());
 ```
 - again if you want to add only first 3 elements form the vector 1 then you can definitely do this
 ```cpp
 vector<int> vec1 = {1,2,3,4,5};
 vector<int> vec2 (vec1.begin(),vec1.begin() + 3);
 //vec 2 = {1,2,3}
 ```
 - again always remember that the last parameter is the end point but it not get added in the vector
 ```cpp
 vector<int> vec1 = {1,2,3,4,5};
 vector<int> vec2 (vec1.begin(),vec1.end()-1);
 for (auto it : vec2) {
 cout<<it<<" ";
 }
 //op
 1 2 3 4
 ```
 ###### Another Method Of Copying Elements
 ```cpp
 vector<int> vec3(vec2);
 for (auto it: vec3) {
 cout<<it<<" ";
 }
 ```
 - again this will also copy all the elements from vec2 to vec3
 #### 2D Vector
 - this is like 2d array, everything is similar except dynamic memory allocation
 ```cpp
  vector<vector<int>> first (10, vector<int> (20));
 for (auto vctr: first) {
 for (auto it: vctr) {
 cout<<it<<" ";
 }
 cout<<endl;
 }
```
#### Array Of Vectors
- we can also define array of vectors where each element inside the array is a vector
```cpp
int main()
{
 vector<int> arr[5];
 vector<int> n1 = {1,2,3,4,5};
 arr[0].push_back(1);
 arr[0].push_back(1);
 arr[0].push_back(1);
 arr[1].push_back(1);

 arr[1].push_back(1);
 arr[1].push_back(1);
 arr[1].push_back(1);

 for(auto ar: arr) {
 for (auto ar2:ar) {
 cout<<ar2<<" ";
 }
 cout<<endl;
 }
 return 0;
 /*

so if you look carefully here array length is static but the elements inside the array that is vector is
 of dynamic
 */
}
```

### Sets
#### Ordered Set
- As we studied about sets in our school and colleges that it stores all the unique elements, means there is no repeat of any element
```cpp
set<int> st;
```
- the most important thing about set is when you insert into the set it will store the elements in increasing order
- and you cant access set elements like st[0], this is totally wrong.
##### Functions
- **st.insert(x)** - this is used to insert elements in the set, it takes logn time
	- again suppose you pass a element in this as a parameter but that element is not in the set then it will work like end(). and we already studied about end() that it returns the next index after the end element of any container 
- **st.find(5)** - this function finds the address of the element 5 in the set and if it will not find then it will return the end address of the set
- **st.emplace(6)** - this is as like insert() but it is little faster than the insert 
- **st.size** - it will print the size of the set
- **st.erase(st.begin())** - this is used to erase elements from the set
	- again you can delete more than one elements in a single line of code
	```cpp
	auto index = st.find(6);
	 st.erase(st.begin(),index);
 	```
 - so in the above code basically we take a end position and inside this it will delete all the elements
 - again you can also delete a single element where ever you want , no matter which index it is but we have to pass the element itself in the parameter
	 ```cpp
	 st.erase(6);
	 ```
#### Unordered Set
- The main difference between the ordered and unordered set is it stores data in random way not in increasing order
- and the biggest difference is its average complexity is O(1) which is far better than ordered list which have O(logn) time complexity
- again in interviews if given a question where the order is does not matter then unordered list is best and try to ignore the ordered list 
```cpp
unordered_set<int> st;
```
- again all the functionality of the ordered list will be work in unordered list
#### Multi Set
- It stores all the elements in the sorted fashion
- same functions work in this
- if you delete element like st.erase(2) then all the instances of 2 in that set will erase at one glance
- again if you try to find the index of the element like **st.find(2)** then if there are more than one 2 in the list then it will return the first index address of that element
- again if you want to erase only one instance then write like **st.erase(st.find(2))**
- again if you want to find how many times a instance occurs then use **st.count(2)**;
### Maps
- Map uses a unique key to identify each element
- again it stores the keys in increasing order or ascending order
- The time complexity of the map is logn
```cpp
int main()
{
 map<string,int> mpp;
 mpp["raj"] = 27;
 mpp["simran"] = 74;
 mpp["gabbar"] = 25;
 mpp["basanti"] = 45;
 mpp["raj"] = 12;
 cout<<mpp["raj"]; //used to print the map in the console
 return 0;
}
```
#### Function Used In Maps
- **mpp.emplace**- This is used to insert an element in the hash table 
- **mpp.erase("raj")** - This will delete this single instance
- **mpp.clear** - Used to delete whole map
- **mpp.erase("mpp.begin()"** - Here we give the iterator as a parameter, so basically it delete only that which is given, again we can give an range fr0m starting to the last range to delete elements in between
- **auto it = mpp.find("raj")** - points to where raj lies, and if raj does not exist then it will point  to the end.
- **mpp.count("raj")** - it will always returns 1
```cpp
//basically the map.empty() returns a boolean which says the map is empty or not
if (mpp.empty()) {
	cout<<"Map is empty";
}
```
##### How To Print A Map
- So if you look carefully then a maps every index storing a pair, `then what is pair?`
```cpp
pair<int,int> pr;
 pr.first = 1;
 pr.second = 2;
 ```
 - As the name, it only stores a pair of element inside it means only two
```cpp
for (auto it:mpp) {
 cout<<it.first<<" "<<it.second<<endl;
 }
```
- Always remember that, here it.first is an object , not a function
- Again if you using an iterator to print the map, then as you know that iterator is a pointer so you have to use '->' operator while accessing the object
```cpp
 for (auto it = mpp.begin(); it != mpp.end(); it++) {
 cout<<it->first<<" "<<it->second<<endl;
 }
```
#### Unordered Map
-  It does not stores in any order
- All the functionality are repeated here but the only advantage is O(1) time complexity in almost every cases and O(n) in worst cases where n is the container size
#### Multi Map
- Sorted and unique keys but each key will contain more than one values
### Pair
- This basically stores pair of data
```cpp
pair<int,int> pr = {1,2};
//here pr.first indicates to 1 whereas pr.second indicates to 2
```
- Again you can do nested pairs
```cpp
pair<pair<int,int>,int> pr = {{1,2},3};
//how you can access this
//pr.first.second = 1
//pr.first.first = 2
```
- again vector of  pair, map of pair or set of pair, everything is possible and this help us to easily solve the problems
```cpp
vector<pair<int,int>> vec;
set<pair<int,int>> st;
map< pair<int,int>, int> map;
```
- The most important note is you can not use pair inside the unordered map

### Stack
- There is iterator concept in stack and queue
- We already know that stack in a data structure which follows lifo method
```cpp
stack<int> st;
```
#### Functions In Stack
- **st.pop()**
- **st.top()**
- **st.size()**- Gives the number of elements in the stack
- **st.empty()**- This returns true if stack is empty and false if stack is non empty
##### Delete The Entire Stack
```cpp
while(!st.empty()) {
	st.pop();
}
```
##### Use of stack.top()
- In competative programming when ever you use the stack.top() then before first check that stack.empty(),`why?` because if you write stack.top() after just declaring the stack variable then this will throw an error
```cpp
stack<int> st;
cout<<st.top();
```
- The above code might be throw some error so always check before implicating stack.top()
### Queue
- First of all remember that there is no iterator concept in stack and queue
- This is opposite of stack, this of of FIFO type
#### Function
- **q.push**
- **q.front()**
- **q.pop()**
- **q.size**
- **q.empty**
```cpp
queue<int> q;
```
- all the above operation takes O(1), except deleting the entire array takes O(N)
#### Priority Queue
- This is the most important data structure that helps us to solve the hard problems
- It stores all the elements in the sorted order and take log n time for 
- All the functions define in the above in queue section are applicable in this also
- it uses the concept of heap sort
- it keeps the maximum element at the top
- Basically it stores elements in descending order
- in priority queue duplicates are allowed
```cpp
priority_queue<int> pq;
```
- again if you declare priority queue like
```cpp
priority_queue<int,int> pq;
pq.push(1, 5);
pq.push(1, 6);
pq.push(1, 7);
```
- if you push elements like the above program then it will stores the elements according to the first elements and if first elements are same then it checks the second elements 
##### Trick to store the smallest element at the top
- while input insert the negation of the element and while extracting multiply -1 so that we can make the priority queue to minimum priority queue
```cpp
priority_queue<int> pq;
 pq.push(-1);
 pq.push(-3);
 pq.push(-6);
```
##### Minimum Priority Queue
```cpp
//syntax for minimum priority queue
priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
/*
again if you want to store the vecotrs instead of int then you can only chnge where int is written
*/
priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;
```
- in the above we studied about how to store minimum elements at the top using the negation method 
- but in this we don't have to use any kind of negation, it automatically stores the minimum value at the top
#### Dequeue
- This is similar to the vector but the only difference is it provides you push back and push front where vector provides you push back
- this is a doubly ended queue
##### Functions 
- push_front(), push_back(), pop_front(), pop_back(), begin(), end(), rbegin(), rend(), size(), clear(), at()
### List
- The best thing about the list is it has the **remove operation and it is of O(1)** time
- push_front(), push_back(), pop_front(), pop_back(), begin(), end(), rbegin(), rend(), size(), clear(), at() and remove()
- if you want a data structure which works in front or back in every side then use list
- this is most used data structure
### Bit Set
- it only stores 1 or 0
- it stores all the data only in one bit
- Bit set is used in a lot of segment tree problem
- it can be bit set of anything like int, float, char etc
- its not a data type, its a container
- if the question is in 1 or 0 then use this instead of array
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
 bitset<4> bt;
 cin>>bt;
 cout<<bt.all()<<endl; //if all bits are 1 then returns true otherwise false
 cout<<bt.any()<<endl; //if any bit is 1 then it return true otherwise false
 cout<<bt.count()<<endl; //this will print the number of set bits 
 bt.flip(); //it will flip all the elements 
 bt.flip(2);//it takes a index as an argument and flip its value, 0 to 1 or 1 to 0
 // 1000-> bt.none() - this will return false but if all bits are nonset then it will return true
 cout<<bt.none()<<endl;

  
 bt.set();//it fills all the indexes with 1
 bt.set(2);//this only second postion os 0

//and suppose if you want to set a specific index as 0 then you have to mention it in the argument
 bt.set(2,0);

  
 bt.reset(); //oppsite of set
 //bt.reset(2,0) this is not possible
 bt.size(); //return the size
 bt.test(1);//it check the index 1 is set or not 
 return 0;
}
```
## Algoritms
### Sort()
- This takes O(nlogn)
- you can also use this to sort in descending order but you need a comparator
