# Test & Set Lock
- Basically it is a hardware solution 
- This method uses a variable named as **LOCK** that is shared between all the processes and this variable is of boolean type
- and the initial value of this variable is 0 that means false
- Suppose a process wants to enter into the critical section, so at that time first it **test** that the shared variable value is true or false
- if the variable value is 1 or true that means another process is using the critical section so that this process have to wait until the shared variable value becomes false
- again if its value is 0 or false then it set its value to 1 or true then enter into the critical section
- It uses an function to test and set the variable state
```c
boolean TestAndSet(boolean *target) {
	boolean rv = *target
	target = true
	return rv;
}
```
- so when a process wants to enter into the critical section then it checks the state if the shared variable using this function
- this function take the shared variable as an argument then store its current value in another variable then set the shared variable value to true then return the previous value of that shared variable that is stored in another variable
- and remember that, this is an **Atomic Operation**
- Atomic function means it cant be interrupted, yes it can be preempted but if after preemption if again it gets executed then it executed from starting, this is the nature of atomic operation
#### Let's Understand The Whole Concept With Examples
- let suppose process p1 wants to enter into the critical section then it have to execute some set of code
```c
do {
	while(TestAndSet(&lock));
	//do nothing
	//critical section
	lock = FALSE
	//reminder function
}while(TRUE);
```
- suppose the value of lock is false then when the while loop gets executed then the TestAndSet() return the value false and set the lock variable to true and p1 executes its critical section
- but if the lock variable is true then TestAndSet() return true and it stuck at that point until the lock variable is false
#### Is it Satisfying Mutual Exclusion
- Let suppose p1 is executed and another process p2 wants to enter into critical section but when it runs the set of code it stuck at the while loop so that why it satisfies the mutual exclusion
#### Is it Satisfying Bounded Waiting
- No its not. `How?`
- let suppose a process p2 wants to enter into the critical section but at that time p1 using the critical section then after that p2 gets preempted and another process p3 wants to enter into critical section and suddenly p1 completes its execution in critical section and then p3 enter into critical section
- when again p2 gets executed it again stuck in the while loop because of p3 is already using the critical section
- so if this happen again and again then p2 doesn't get executed and there is a starvation problem arises
#### Summery
- so basically it satisfies the mutual exclusion but doesn't satisfy the bounded waiting requirement so this solution is not that perfect for process synchronization
