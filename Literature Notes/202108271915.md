# Dijkstra Algorithm
- This is for single source shortest path problem
- single source means we have to select a source vertex among all those vertices given in the graph and we have to find the shortest path using that vertex as source 
- yes you can choose any vertex as source vertex
- This is a minimum path finding problem so this is an optimization problem and we can solve this problem using greedy approach and we already studied that greedy method is a step by step approach which solve by taking one stage at a time and considering one input at a time to get a optimal solution and it is always find the best solution in every stage without thinking of the future
- my be in future this will be not a optimal approach but greedy algorithm does not take care of that
- this algorithm can work on directed or undirected graph
