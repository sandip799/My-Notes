# Python Day 4
## Random Module
- Random module created by python to generate random number, we just have to import that and then use this 
#### Create Random Whole Number
```py
import random
print(random.randint(1,3))
```
#### Create Random Decimal Number
```py
import random
print(random.random())
```
- so random.random() generates random numbers between 0.0000 to 0.00009 but not 1
- `But question is how can we generate random decimal numbers between 0 to 5 ?` answer is you can multiply whole number with the random whole number
```py
import random
print(5 * random.random())
```
- basically the above program generates number between 0 to 4.9999
## Create Your Own Module & Link With Other Program
- You can create your own module and add this to another program that you want 
### Example
```py
#my_module
pi= 3.1415
```
```py
import my_module
print(my_module.pi)
```
- in above example i just create my own module and define pi value there, then i import that in another program but before that i include that in the program then i use all that stuff using the dot operator along with the module name
## Python List
- List is nothing but a data structure, means it is just the way of organizing and storing data in python
- we already studied about variable that store only single piece of data but sometimes you might have to store grouped data
- like example if you want to store all the states of the India then at that case to minimize the user work we use list which helps to store the large amount of data in a single variable
- and in other cases you might have to store data in ordered list
- in python you can store different types of data type in a single list, it may be either string or int or boolean etc
```py
my_list = [sandip, ray, siba, prana, utkal, himanshu, shyam]
```
- always indexing starting with 0 `why?` because it shows the offset means there is no element before first element of the list, that's why its offset 0
- again you can access the element using the negative index like
```py
print(my_list[-1])
#Output
shyam
```
- so if we use the negative index then it access item from end of the list
### Split()
- this is used to convert a string into a list but you have pass a parameter and whenever it encounter while generating list it make that part of string into s separate element in list
#### Example
```py
customer_list = input("Give me everybody's name, separated by a comma. ");
list = customer_list.split(",")
print(list)
#OUTPUT
Give me everybody's name, separated by a comma. siba,sandip,ray
["siba",sandip,ray]
```
- as we pass comma as a parameter so whenever comma encounters it split that sub string into a element in the list
### Nested List
- We can put many list inside a list, that is called as nested list
- suppose you have two list, one is of name of the Indian cricket team men players and another list is of Indian cricket team women players
- but if we look at carefully these two list is connected with each other like they are play for India
- so in this stage we can put these two lists in a single list
#### Example
```py
men_team = ["rohit","virat","subhman","hardik"]
women_team = ["mandana","harleen","mitali","priya"]
india_team = [men_team,women_team]
print(india_team)
print(india_team[0])
print(india_team[0][0])
```
- in above program there are three list, one is of men_team , women_team and last one is india_team
- here india_team is a combination of both men and women team and these are elements in this list
- when line 4 gets executed then all the player name will printed in console but in one square bracket all the men player and in another square all the women players
- when line 5 gets executed then only men player list will show in console because it is the 0 th index element
- when line 6 gets executed then only rohit gets printed because as it is a nested list so it shows the first element of the 0th index element of the nested list
