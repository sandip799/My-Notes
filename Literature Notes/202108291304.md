# Python Day 5
## Sum()
- this is used to add up all the elements in a list
```py
list = [1,2,3,4]
print(sum(list))
#output
10
```
## Max()
- this is used to return the max value in the list
```py
list = [1,2,3,4]
print(max(list))
#output
4
```
## Range()
- this is used along side with for loop
```py
add = 0
for num in range(1,101):
 add += num
print(f"Addition of the numbers between 1 to 100 = {add}")
```
- you can see that here i write from 1 to 101 but it only include numbers from 1 to 100, not 101
- by default it increase the number by one but if you want to increase your number according to your own then you can add a third parameter along with the range
```py
for x in range(1,10,3):
 print(x)
```
 - its output becomes 1,3,7
 ## Append()
 - This function used with a list and this is used to insert something in a list
 - again if you want to insert a character inside a list then you can do it easily like string concatenation, here also you can use the + operator to include a string in a list but it is a good practice to use the append function here
 ## random.suffle()
 - This is used to randomly organize all the elements inside a list
 ## How can we print without new line in python
 ```py
 print("hello world!",end="")
 ```
 - if we write end = "" at the end of the print function then there will be no new line arises
