## Merging Two List
- Merging is the process of combining two sorted list in a single sorted list
- So compare first element of array 1 with the first element of array2 the element which is smaller is copying to the new sorted array then increase the iterator of the array which element is pushed just now and so on
- at last if any of those finishes and other one has some elements then use for loop to insert all those elements to the new array
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int * mergeArray(int arr1[], int arr2[], int size1, int size2) {
 int *p = malloc (sizeof(int) * (size1 + size2));
 int i = 0;
 int j = 0;
 int k = 0;
 while (i < size1 && j < size2) {
 if (arr1[i] < arr2[j]) {
 p[k] = arr1[i];
 i++; 
 k++;
 }
 else {
 p[k] = arr2[j];
 j++; 
 k++;
 }
 }
 for (;i < size1; i++) {
 p[k] = arr1[i];
 }
 for (;j < size2; j++) {
 p[k] = arr2[j];
 }
 return p;
}
int main()
{
 int *p = NULL;
 int arr1[] = {2, 10, 18, 20, 23};
 int arr2[] = {4, 9, 19, 25};
 int size1 = sizeof(arr1) / sizeof(arr1[0]);
 int size2 = sizeof(arr2) / sizeof(arr2[0]);
 p = mergeArray(arr1,arr2,size1,size2);
 for (int i = 0; i < (size1+size2); i++) {
 printf("%d ",p[i]);
 }
return 0;
}
```
- Here the time complexity of this code is **O(m+n)** where m is the number of elements in array1 and n is the number of elements in array2
## Merging Two List In Single Array
- It is possible that there will be two different array in a single array 
	###### Example
	```c
	[2,5,8,12,3,6,7,10]
	```
- So in the above example one list is from 2 to 12 and another list is from 3 to 10 and both the list are sorted
- Again we want the result in the same array only, then `how can we do?` so remember that you can't merge in just one array, this is impossible.
- You can create another array where you can store the sorted array and then copy all the elements of the sorted array into the existing array
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int * mergeArray(int *arr, int low, int high, int mid) {
 int *p = malloc (sizeof(int) * (low + high + 1));
 int i = low;
 int j = mid + 1;
 int k = 0;
 while (i <= mid && j <= high) {
 if (arr[i] < arr[j]) {
 p[k] = arr[i];
 i++; 
 k++;
 }
 else {
 p[k] = arr[j];
 j++; 
 k++;
 }
 }
 for (;i <= mid; i++) {
 p[k] = arr[i];
 }
 for (;j <= high; j++) {
 p[k] = arr[j];
 }
 for (int i = 0; i <= high; i++) {
 arr[i] = p[i];
 }
}
int main()
{
 int arr[] = {2,5,8,12,3,6,7,10};
 mergeArray(arr,0,7,3);
 for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) 
 printf("%d ",arr[i]);
 }
return 0;
}
```
## Merging Multiple List
- Suppose i take 4 sorted list and i want to sort in a single list, then `what could be the procedure?`
- Note that if you want to merge m sorted list then it is called as **M-Way Merging**, here m can be anything
-  Again suppose there are m no of list are given but you divide those into group of pairs and then sort them and keep this process until there are only one list left, this method is called as **2-Way Merging**. And **Merge Sort** uses 2-way merging pattern
