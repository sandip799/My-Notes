# Recursion
- If a function calling itself then it is called as recursive function
- There must be some base condition to terminates the recursion otherwise it will go into for infinite time
```c
void fun1(int x) {
	if (x > 0) {
		printf("%d ",x);
		fun1(x-1);
	}
}
int main() {
	int x = 3;
	fun1(x);
}
```
- Again if we want to know how recursion is work then we have to trace the function and we can do it easily by writing all the function calls using tree in graphical way
- Again recursion has two phases, one is calling phase and another one is returning phase
```c
void fun(int n) {
	if(n > 0) {
		statement1...;
		fun(n - 1) * 2;
		statement2...;
	}
}
```
- If you observe carefully then statement 1 will be execute at the function calling time , and we can call it as ascending
- But the statement 2 and the multiplication with the function will be executed at the returning time, and we can call it as descending
- So the main important thing we learn hear is recursion has two phase one is ascending and another one is descending
- `what is the difference between loops and recursion?`, yes recursion is work like an loop but the loop only has ascending phase whereas the recursion has both ascending and descending phase and this is the power of the recursion that you can use to write codes in easier way
- **Note** - Every loop can be written in recursive way and every recursive function can be written using loops
#### How Recursion Uses Stack
- Whenever a function is called, it may be the user defined function or may be the main function then an activation record is maintained inside the stack 
- Each function has its own separate memory block, if we take an example then every function is a container where all the variables are stored inside the container which is belongs to that specific function
- The most important thing is whenever the recursive function called it creates another container for that particular in the stack
- Again number of activation records depends upon the number of calls so recursive function is a memory consuming function

#### Time Complexity Of A Recursive Function
- First of all you can easily calculate time complexity of the recursive function by using the recursion tree and remember that calculate it as unit, not in seconds or milliseconds
###### Methods To Find Out Time Complexity
- First of all take the function as T(n), then find out the time when n = 0,then use the induction method to find out the time complexity of the problem
#### Static Variable In The Recursion
- If you declare a variable with static keyword inside a function then it will be stored in data region, not inside the stack and if integer then the value of that one will be zero
- Again here question arise `is it created every time when a function is called ?` no it is only created for one time when the function is called
- Again whenever you are using the tracing tree then if there are any static variable declared then don't write it in the tree, always write it separated form the tree and update the value there
- Again this all above characteristic are applied for global variable also
## Types Of Recursion
### Tail Recursion
- if the last statement of the function is the recursive call then it is called as tail recursion
- that means all operations are performed at calling time only and there is no operation performed at the returning time
```
fun(n) {
	------
	------
	fun(n - 1) + n;
}
```
- the above example is not a tail recursion, because in tail recursion there is no operation performed at returning time but here addition operation performed that,s why this is not tail recursion.
- again tail recursion is easily converted into loops and the conclusion is if you  writing tail recursion then write is using loops because it takes less space as recursion takes space to store the activation record 
- **Note**- some compiler change the tail recursion to loops to reduce the space complexity internally
### Head Recursion
- it is just opposite of the tail recursion, here the first statement of the program is the recursive call
- but we have to tweak something to convert it into loops but tail recursion is very easy to convert.
### Linear Recursion
- when a function call itself only one time then this is called as linear recursion
### Tree Recursion
- when a function call itself more than one time then it that type of recursion is called as tree recursion
### Excessive Recursion
- Some recursive methods repeats the computations for some parameters, which results in long computation time even for simple cases
### Practice
- Sum of N natural numbers
- Factorial of n 
- Power using recursion
- Taylor Series
- Fibonacci Series
