# Python Day 6
## Function
- [[What is Function In Programming Language]]
```py
def my_fun():
	statement
	---------
	---------
```
- Indentation is very very important in this so always try to write the code with the proper indentation
## While Loop
```py
while something_is_true:
	#Do this
	#Then do this
```
- `How to write negation of the condition?`
```py
while not condition:
    statement
```
- So we use not for the negation
- we use while loop when we want to run the code many time till the condition is true
- while loop is more dangerous than for loops because you are setting a time of for loop but here it goes and goes until the condition became false
- while loop is best for the infinite loop
