# Semaphores
- First of all this is a software based solution
- Semaphore is proposed by **Edsger Dijkstra**, is a technique to manage concurrent processes by using a simple integer value, which is known as a semaphore.
- Semaphore is simply a variable which is**non negative** and shared between threads. This variable is used to solve the critical section problem and tho achieve process synchronization in the multiprocessing system
- A semaphore is an integer variable that , apart from initialization, is accessed by only through two standard atomic operation: **wait()** and **signal()** where wait is used for testing and signal is used to signal other process that "i have completed using the semaphore and if you want to use then you can"
```cpp
P(Semaphore S) {
	while(S <= 0);  //no operation if the condition is true
	S--;
}
```
```cpp
V(Semaphore S) {
	S++;
}
```
- So if a process is going to use the critical section then first it use the wait() and then enter into the critical section and when it finishes its execution then it increase the value of that variable using the signal()
- **NOTE**- All the modification to the integer value of the semaphore in the wait() and signal operations must be executed individually, That means when one process modifies the semaphore value then no other process can simultaneously modify that same semaphore value
## Types Of Semaphore
### 1. Binary Semaphore
- From the name we can understand that its range between 0 to 1 and on some systems, binary semaphores are known as mutex locks as they are locks that provide mutual exclusion. `How it provide mutual exclusion?`
- So in binary semaphores if the value of the semaphore is 0 then one process is using the critical section and if 1 then no other process are using the semaphore
- In binary semaphore initially the value of the semaphore is 1 and suppose the critical section is completely free now, the first the process run the wait() and it decrement the semaphore value and enter into the critical section
- Suppose at this moment another process try to enter into the critical section then it have to run the wait function first and when the condition is checked then after that it will stuck on a infinite loop so that until the previous process not finished its execution yet it will stuck and after the finishing the use of critical section it increments the semaphore  value using the signal() and then other process can enter into the critical section
### 2. Counting Semaphore
- Its value can range over an unrestricted domain (means it can be more than one). 
- It is used to control access to a resources that has a multiple instances
- Suppose there is a resource which have 2 instances and there are three process want to use the resource, so at that time the value of semaphore is 2 and then when two processes are use instances of this process then the semaphore value becomes 0 and the third process cant able to use this and after any process finish its execution after that the third process can enter into critical section
