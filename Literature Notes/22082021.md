# Divide & Conquer
- So basically this is a problem solving approach or strategy to solve a problem.
- So it divide the problem into small small sub problem and the sub problem should be as same as the original problem, this means suppose you applying this technique in a sorting problem then all the sub problems must be of sorting type
- Lets understand this with an example, suppose you organizing a function in your college, so you have to do a lots of work, so you split the work among your friends and give them different kinds of work like inviting the teachers, buy thing from market and etc , here as you can see all sub problems problems are different from each other so you cant apply divide and conquer method here
- again as there are many sub problems then their are many solutions, so at last you have a method to combine those solutions otherwise the method is just waste of time
- Basically it is a recursive strategy, so you have to learn about recursive algorithm and how to write recursive function to and how to analyze this 

## Example
```cpp
	DAC(P)
	{
		if(small(P))
		{
			S(P);
		}
		else
		{
			divide P into P1,P2,P3....Pk
			Apply DAC(P1),DAC(P2),....
			Combine(DAC(P1),DAC(P2)....)
		}
	}
```
- If your problem is very small that it cant be divided further then you have to write code for that small problem, that's why we use if statement here
