# Process
- A process is an instance of a program in execution.
-  To put it in simple terms, we write our computer programs in a text file and when we execute this program, it becomes a process which performs all the tasks mentioned in the program.
-  When a program is loaded into the memory and it becomes a process, it can be divided into four sections â”€ stack, heap, text and data. The following image shows a simplified layout of a process inside main memory
