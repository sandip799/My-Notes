# Syntax
- **Create Table**- CREATE TABLE table_name (var, var, var.....);
- **Deleting The Table** - DROP TABLE table_name;
- **Foreign Key Insertion** -
	 FOREIGN KEY(new_column_name)
	 REFERENCES table_name(column_name_of_that_table)
	 ON DELETE SET NULL;
- **Add Foreign Key On a Existing Table** - 
	ALTER TABLE table_name 
	ADD FOREIGN KEY(column_name)
	REFERENCES table_name(column_name_of_primary key)
	ON DELETE SET NULL;
- **Composite Key With Foreign Keys**-
	 CREATE TABLE table_name (
	 	var 1, 
		varn2,
		PRIMARY KEY (var1, var2),
		FOREIGN KEY(var1) REFERENCES table_name(primary_key_of the table) ON DELETE CASCADE,
		FOREIGN KEY(var2) REFERENCES table_name(primary_key_of the table) ON DELETE CASCADE,
	 );
- **Describe A Table** - DESCRIBE table_name;
- **Add a Column In a Existing Table**- 
	ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name DATATYPE;
- **Inserting a Row in a Table**-
	INSERT INTO table_name VALUES(all_variables);
- **Inserting Specific Variables in a Row** -
	INSERT INTO table_name(specific_column_name) VALUES(all_variables);
- **Update a Column** - 
	UPDATE table_name
	SET column_name
	WHERE conditions (optional);
	
## More Basic Queries
### AS
- suppose there is a employee table in which first_name and last_name are two attributes 
- and you want to show all the data of these two column but when the data will printed in the console instead of first_name or last_name it will show names according to your choice like forename and surname
#### Example
##### Before
```sql
---fing the first and last names of all the employee
SELECT first_name,last_name
FROM Employee;
```

| first_name | last_name |
| ---------- | --------- |
| David      | Wallace   |
| Jan        | Levinson  |
| Michael    | Scott     |
| Angela     | Martin    |
| Kelly      | Kapoor    | 

##### After
```sql
---fing the first and last names of all the employee
SELECT first_name AS forename,last_name AS surname
FROM Employee;
```

| forename | surname  |
| -------- | -------- |
| David    | Wallace  |
| Jan      | Levinson |
| Michael  | Scott    |
| Angela   | Martin   |
| Kelly    | Kapoor   |

    
### DISTINCT
- this is used to show all the unique elements in a column
```sql
---find out all the different genders from the employee table
SELECT DISTINCT sex
FROM Employee;
```
```sql
---find out all the different genders from the employee table
SELECT DISTINCT salry
FROM Employee;
```
## Functions
### COUNT
-  This is a function which have some set of instruction and when we use them it will run all the instructions and provide us the proper output as we want
```sql
SELECT COUNT(emp_id)
FROM Employee;
```
- it only counts all the entry not the null value
- suppose there are 9 columns and 2 columns are null then it will give output 7
```sql
---find out the number of female employee born after 1970
SELECT COUNT(emp_id)
FROM Employee
WHERE sex = 'F' AND birth_date > '1970-01-01';
```

### AVG
- this function used to find out the average of anything that you pass as parameter inside the function
```sql
---find the average of all employees salary
SELECT AVG(salary)
FROM Employee;
```
```sql
---find the average of all employees salary where sex is male
SELECT AVG(salary)
FROM Employee
WHERE sex = 'M';
```
### SUM
- this is basically sum up all the rows in the column
```sql
---find out the sum pf all employees salary
SELECT SUM(salary)
FROM Employee;
```
### GROUP BY
- it shows the list with unique row
- suppose there is a column where the data in the column is repeating but if we want to show how much time it occurs in the table then we use group by,
- suppose there is a column named as sex which have 9 entries where six are male and 3 are female. if we want to show that how many number of male and female the column has then we use group by
- it filters all the things then shows the number of male and female and it takes only two row.
```sql
---find out how many males and females are there
SELECT COUNT(sex),sex
FROM Employee
GROUP BY sex;
```
```sql
---find the total sales of each salesman
SELECT emp_id,SUM(total_sales)
FROM works_with
GROUP BY emp_id;
```
## Wildcard
- If you want to find few letter or characters or something like this from a table and you don't have a brief knowledge about that information then you can use the wild card
- it is like a google search engine, if the data you pass in query is in the table then it will find and show you that
- Here 2 characters are used which helps to find the characters 
	- **%** - if you finding something but you don't know that ether it is a unique word or it is associated with other word the you use this character for finding the data from the table
	- **__**- again if you have the proper idea about the data then you can use underscore, proper idea means suppose you want to show all the clients who born on october and you know that date column data looks like **13-03-2020** then you can use underscore symbol, again `how you can use this?` you can use this like `__-10`,if you are searching for the month october
	- if you look at the upper example then you can see that there only 2 characters left before `-`, that's why we write like this
- it is very useful when you are creating a searching application where you have to search data, then it will very useful and give you the data
## UNION
- When you want to show 2 different table result at a glance then you can use union
- suppose you want to employee name from employee table and branch name from branch table to show in a single column then at that time union is used
```sql
SELECT first_name
FROM employee
UNION
SELECT branch_name
FROM branch;

---OUTPUT
first_name
----
---
---
list
```
- If you look above example carefully then there is only one column given in each select statement, so this is very important that you have to give same number of columns for both the table
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employee
UNION
SELECT branch_name
FROM branch;

---OUTPUT
first_name
----
---
---
list
```
- The above example will throw an error because we define 2 columns in employee table while only one column in branch table
- again they also have the similar data type
- again you can use more than one union statement at a time 
- again you will notice that, when you print the list then the column name always be the first table column which is the part of union, again you can change it by using **AS** 
```sql
SELECT first_name AS Company_Name
FROM employee
UNION
SELECT branch_name
FROM branch
UNION
SELECT client
FROM client_name;

---OUTPUT
first_name
----
---
---
list
```
- Again sometimes when you are doing union of the tables then if suppose they both have the same foreign key and you have to write both column name so there will be some misconception while recognizing, so for that we can use the table name with dot symbol to specify that particular column
```sql
SELECT client_name, client.branch_id
FROM client
UNION
SELECT supplier_name, branch_supplier.branch_id
FROM branch_supplier;
```
- So as you can see that in the above program branch_id repeatedly used in both the table, so to improve understanding we use this method and in lots of circumstances it will be highly useful

## Joins
- it helps to combine rows from two or more different tables based on the related column
```sql
---find all the branches and the name of their managers
SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name
FROM employee
JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id;
```
- it combines all the rows from employee table and all the rows from branch table as long as the employee table emp_id is equal to branch table manager_id
#### Left Join
- it shows all the rows of the column specified in the code of the first table and only show the specific rows of the 2nd table
```sql
---find all the branches and the name of their managers
SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name
FROM employee
LEFT JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id;
```
#### Right Join
- it is the reverse of the left join where in left join rows of first table are printed while here rows of 2nd table are printed
```sql
---find all the branches and the name of their managers
SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name
FROM employee
RIGHT JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id;
```
