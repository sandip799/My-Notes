# Turing Machine
- **Def** - Turing machines are simple abstract computational devices intended to help investigate the extent and limitations of what can be computed
- A Turing machine (TM) is a kind of state machine at any time the machine is in any one of the finite number of states
- Instructions for a Turing machine include specification of conditions under which the machine will make transitions from one state to other
### Components Of A Turing Machine
- Tape
- Tape Head for read and write (Each cell will contain a single character)
- Control Unit (Transition Diagram just like DFA)
#### Tape
`What is a tape?` a tape is divided into a sequence of numbered cells (that is 1,2,3,4 like this) or squares one next to other
- Each cell contains a symbol from some finite alphabet
- The alphabet contains a blank symbol "B" and one or more other symbols
- Set of symbols obtain is denoted by "taaooo" symbol
#### Head
- A tape head is always stationed at one of the tape cells and provide communication for the interaction between the tape and control unit
- At the beginning of the processing the tape head always begins by reading the input in cell number "i"
- The head can never move left from the cell i and if it is given an order to do so the machine crashes
- In a single step a tape head reads the contents of a cell on the tape reads a symbol replaces with some other character and reposition itself to the next cell to the right or to the left of the one it has just read or does not move(i.e move straight or right or does not move)
#### Control Unit
- The control unit contains set of states(q)
- **Initial State** - 
- **Halt State** - this is the state in which the Turing machine stops all further operation , it is denoted by H and H is a subset of q. 
- There can be one or more halt states
- **Other States**-Other states are final states and intermediate states
#### Description Of The Turing Machine
- if there are two states p and q (a->b,l) a is input, b is writing and l is tape head is move to left
##### NOTE
- in Turing machine there must not be any epsilon transition not allowed
